# 📘 React & SPA Overview

## ✅ What is SPA (Single-Page Application)?
A **Single-Page Application** is a web app that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content without refreshing the whole page.

### 🔹 Benefits of SPA
- Faster navigation after initial load
- Improved user experience
- Reduced server load
- Seamless transitions between views

---

## ⚛️ What is React?
**React** is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially SPAs. It allows developers to build reusable UI components.

### 🔹 How React Works
- Uses **components** to structure UI
- Implements a **Virtual DOM** to optimize rendering
- Updates only the parts of the page that change

## 🔁 SPA vs MPA

| Feature           | SPA                            | MPA                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Page Reload       | No                              | Yes                            |
| Speed             | Fast after initial load         | Slower due to full reloads     |
| Routing           | Client-side (React Router)      | Server-side                    |
| Code Complexity   | Higher front-end complexity     | Backend-heavy                  |

## 👍 Pros and 👎 Cons of SPA

### Pros
- Better UX and faster performance
- Efficient data handling
- Works well with APIs

### Cons

## 🧠 React Basics & Virtual DOM

- **JSX**: JavaScript + HTML syntax
- **Components**: Reusable, independent UI blocks
- **Props & State**: Data management within components
- **Virtual DOM**: A lightweight copy of the real DOM; React updates the DOM efficiently by comparing diffs

## ✨ Key Features of React
- Component-based architecture
- Virtual DOM
- Unidirectional data flow
- JSX support
- Strong ecosystem with community support
- Declarative UI design
